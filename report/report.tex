\section{Introduction}
	
	\hspace{0.6cm}In the context of our lesson LPHY1300 personal project, we 
	had to simulate a particle detector using the finite elements method. We 
	thus develop our program "pdetect" which simulates the electric potential 
	and electric field inside a pixel detector. It also computes the electric 
	current induce by an incident particle with a given trajectory.

	In this paper we will first introduce briefly what the finite elements 
	method is, and then a library we used in our program, "deal.II".
	Afterwhat we will explain properly our program, the way it works, and 
	also comparing our results with the results of "weightfield", another 
	simulator of a particle detector, already use in many experiences.
	To finish this paper we will talk about two specific cases of detector,
	a silicon detector, and a helium detector.

	\subsection*{Finite elements method}

		\hspace{0.6cm}The finite element method is a numerical technique for 
		finding approximate solutions to boundary value problems for partial 
		differential equations. The finite elements method subdivides a large 
		problem into smaller, simpler, parts, called finite elements. The 
		simple equations that model these finite elements are then assembled 
		into a larger system of equations that models the entire problem. It 
		then uses variational methods from the calculus of variations to 
		approximate a solution by minimizing an associated error function.
